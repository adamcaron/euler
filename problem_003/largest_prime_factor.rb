# find the prime factors of a number

# can it be divided by a number
# other than 1 or itself?

# Does it have any divisors other than itself and 1?

# how can we check if a number
# has any divisors other than 1 and itself?

# given 6
# is it divisible by 2?

# If a number ends in 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0,
# then one of its factors is 2

# If a number ends in 5 or 0,
# then one of its factors is 5

# Now that we've found all the multiples
# of two through ten,
# we've found all the prime numbers
# because they only have factors of 1 & themselves.

# Primes up to 100 are:
